You can use the await keyword on its own (outside of an async function) within a JavaScript module. This means modules, with child modules that use await, wait for the child module to execute before they themselves run. All while not blocking other child modules from loading.

Here is an example of a simple module using the Fetch API and specifying await within the export statement. Any modules that include this will wait for the fetch to resolve before running any code.
